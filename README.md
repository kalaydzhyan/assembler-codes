# Assembler codes

Here I upload some of the Assembler (Assembly) language codes intended for sharing.

## patch.asm

Example of a code patching an executable *.com file with a piece of arbitrary code (in this case, requestng a password to continue execution).
Comments are in Russian, but can be translated, if requested.

## UICtelescope.asm

Code for an amateur radio telescope, prepared for the astronomy club at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Circuit layout is described in *RadioTelescope.pdf*.
